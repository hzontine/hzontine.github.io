&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my first post, I would like to highlight the amazing experience I had at the CSSSA 2016 conference. My professor, Dr. Davies, and I studied and implemented published Opinion Dynamics models this past summer with UMW's Summer Science Institute. Suprised with our findings, we co-authored a paper with the hope to make other researchers aware of the importance two simple implementation choices can have on the model's rate of convergence. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our paper was accepted into the conference, I was overjoyed. Thanks to UMW and the generous support of a donor, I travelled to Santa Fe, New Mexico for the first time mid-November. While I was anxious about presenting to a crowd of smart people, I oddly felt prepared. Since I spent the entire summer reading, analyzing, and re-producing the basic foundations of the literature, I knew my stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSSSA is a one-track conference, where we sat in one room each day and listened to each other's presentations. The intimate nature brought a sense of commrade to the group. kind words of support were plentiful. The keynote speaker of the conference was my hero, Josh Epstein, a pioneer of Generative Social Science. Dr. Davies and I studied his book, _Growing Artifical Socities_, and used its powerful knowledge to help us cultivate an artifical society of agents who hold opinions and interact with others. In Santa Fe, I had the opportunity to sit with Josh and discuss his more recent book, _Agent Zero_. We even got a picture together at the end of the conference before he had to catch his flight home.
