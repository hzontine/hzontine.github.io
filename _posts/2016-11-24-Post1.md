<dd>      () () () For my first post, I would like to highlight the amazing experience I had at the Computation Social Science Society of the Americas 2016 conference. My professor, Dr. Davies, and I studied and implemented published Opinion Dynamics models this past summer with UMW's Summer Science Institute. Suprised with our findings, we co-authored a paper with the hope to make other researchers aware of the importance two simple implementation choices can have on the model's rate of convergence. When our paper was accepted into the conference, I was overjoyed. Thanks to UMW and the generous support of a donor, I travelled to Santa Fe, New Mexico for the first time mid-November. While I was anxious about presenting to a crowd of smart people, I oddly felt prepared. Since I spent the entire summer reading, analyzing, and re-producing the basic foundations of the literature, I knew my stuff.</dd>
<dd>      The conference was a one-track conference, as in we all sat in one room and listened to each other's presentations. The intimate nature of the conference brought commrade to the group and kind words of support were plentiful. The keynote speaker of the conference was my hero, Josh Epstein, a pioneer of Generative Social Science. Dr. Davies and I studied his book, _Growing Artifical Socities_, and used its powerful knowledge to help us cultivate an artifical society of agents who hold opinions and interact with others. In Santa Fe, I had the opportunity to sit with Josh and discuss his more recent book, _Agent Zero_. We even got a picture together at the end of the conference before he had to catch his flight home.
