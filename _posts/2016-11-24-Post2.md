&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks after I took my last final of the 2015 Spring semester, I began to conduct research with Dr. Davies at UMW on the topic of Opinion Dynamics literature. I was incredibly blessed to be given this opportunity through UMW's Summer Science Institute to work one-on-one for 10 weeks with my favorite professor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Thursday afternoon, I met with the other students and professors from the Summer Science Institute. We were encouraged to elaborate in detail our research topic and procedures to one another for the sake of familarizing ourselves with the process of explaining research.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to the end of July, the Summer Science Symposium marks the end of my 10 week internship. Thanks to one all-nighter and many cups of coffee, I completed my poster and printed it the morning of with an hour to spare. Even though I was sleep-deprived, I knew the material well and confidently nailed my presentation.

If you are interested in reading my poster, you can find it in the basement of Trinkle.
If you wish to read the pdf version, email me at [hzontine@gmail.com](mailto:hzontine@gmail.com) and I'll send it to you.



Here am I standing next to the poster I presented to the SSI:
