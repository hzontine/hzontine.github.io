&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the summer, I worked with Dr. Davies at UMW to conduct research into the Opinion Dynamics literature. Each week, I presented to other students and professors in the Institute for the purpose of familarizing ourselves with our own material. During those 8 weeks of research, I worked with Dr. Davies tirelessly to reach our vision. 

This is the poster I presented to the Summer Science Institute:
