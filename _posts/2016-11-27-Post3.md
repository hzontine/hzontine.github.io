Currently, I am enrolled in CPSC 350, Applications of Databases. While the focus of the class is databases, we are also tasked with applying it to a web application. It requires a relatively simple combination of Python on the back-end and Flask on the front-end. For example, in the code below, the first line creates a server sided call, while the function in the second line will handle the call in Python.

{% highlight python %}

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def mainIndex():
  # Insert code here

{% endhighlight %}

For the purpose of handling the database connection and future queries, Psycopg2, a Python library that creates a connection to a PostgreSQL database, has to be imported like so:

{% highlight python %}

import psycopg2;

{% endhighlight %}

Next, we need to make a function that connects to our PostgreSQL database.

{% highlight python %}

def connectToDatabase():
 return psycopg2.connect('dbname=session user=hzontine password=password host=localhost')

{% endhighlight %}
