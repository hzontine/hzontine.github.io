title: Python-Flask

Currently, I am enrolled in CPSC 350, Applications of Databases. While the focus of the class is databases, we are also tasked with applying it to a web application. It requires a relatively simple combination of Python on the back-end and Flask on the front-end. For example, the Python code below 



{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
