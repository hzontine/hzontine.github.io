title: Python-Flask

Currently, I am enrolled in CPSC 350, Applications of Databases. While the focus of the class is databases, we are also tasked with applying it to a web application. It requires a relatively simple combination of Python on the back-end and Flask on the front-end. For example, in the code below, the first line creates a server sided call, while the function in the second line will handle the call in Python. The route decorator is required before each function to tell Flask which URL it should be triggered.

{% highlight python %}

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def mainIndex():
  # Insert code here

{% endhighlight %}

## Importing
  * Flask: Must be imported before we can create an instance of the Flask Class.
  * Psycopg2: Python library that creates a connection to a PostgreSQL database. Used to handle database connection and all of our queries.

{% highlight python %}

from flask import Flask
import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras

{% endhighlight %}

## Creating an instance of Flask

Since we wish to create an instance for a single module as opposed to an application, we must give Flask() the parameter, __name__. This is essential because Flask needs to know where to look for your templates, static files, etc.

{% highlight python %}

app = Flask(__name__)
{% endhighlight %}

## Connecting to our PostgreSQL database

Next, we need to make a function that connects to our database.

{% highlight python %}

def connectToDatabase():
 return psycopg2.connect('dbname=session user=hzontine password=password host=localhost')

{% endhighlight %}
 
Inside each function we wish to access the database, the following code must appear:

{% highlight python %}

conn = connectToDB()
cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor)

{% endhighlight %}

The parameter of conn.cursor() is not essential; however, it does force our results into a Python Dictionary-like container, which can be helpful.

## Running a Query

#### Good Programming Practice: Always wrap this code in a _Try Catch_ statement!

When cur.mogrify() is run, the value of the variable queryVar is set to equal the select statement string with the respective values in queryTerm replacing the instances of %s. The string, queryVar, must set as the lone parameter to the execute() method and called on our cursor object, cur. By wrapping this code in a try statement, should the cur.execute() fail, an error will be printed in order to aid the debugging process. With cur.fetchall(), all of the data computed is assigned to the results variable. However, if you were to replace that line with cur.fetchone(), results would only equal the first row of information returned by the method. 

{% highlight python %}
queryTerm = ('Harry Potter', 'Action')
queryVar = cur.mogrify("SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE %s AND genre = %s ORDER BY name;", (queryTerm,))
try:
  cur.execute(queryVar)
  results = cur.fetchall()
except Exception as e:
  print("Select from movies failed: %s" % e)
{% endhighlight %}
