title: Flask-SocketIO
---

In CPSC 350, I was also challenged to learn how to communicate real time between clients and my server. This is easily implemented with Flask through Socket.IO.

## What is SocketIO?

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications.It is composed of two parts:
 
  * a client-side library that runs in the browser 
  * server-side library for node.js. 
  
Both components have essentially an identical API. This AngularJS wrapper for Controllers can send data from the front-end to the back-end, and the back to the front. Similar to node.js, Socket.IO is _event-driven_.

## Importing Flask extension

The extension socketio must be imported from Flask.

{% highlight python %}

from flask.ext.socketio import SocketIO, emit, join_room, leave_room, send

{%endhighlight%}
