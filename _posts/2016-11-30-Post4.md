title: Good Habits
---


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One lessson I have learned on my path to a CS degree is that implementing good programming habits will not only aid your understanding of your current material but your education and future career. First and foremost, give your variables explicative names so your code is as apparent and straightforward as possible. When you start a program, write enough skeleton code to execute the program. If you debug consistently not only will bugs be easier to comprehend, but you'll end up saving yourself a lot of time. Another valuable habit to alleviate the troubleshooting process is inserting print statements as you go. Many times I have found myself debuging erroneous code by adding numerous print statements struggling to locate an issue. Wrapping code that may cause an error in a Try Catch statement can save you time and stress in the long run when you're trying to understand an ugly bug that doesn't make any sense.
