&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A session is the interval time starting when a client logs into a server and ending when he/she logs out. Session data is stored in a temporary directory and must remain on the server until the client leaves. Sessions are essential if you wish to keep a user logged in to the site, to personalize the layout of the site for users who are logged in, or track users who visit the site.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A session with each client is assigned a Session ID. The data is stored on top of cookies and the server cryptographically signs them. In order to do this, your Flask application must defined a SECRET_KEY.

{%highlight python%}
from flask import Flask, session
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'
app.debug = True
{%endhighlight%}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A session object is a dictionary object composing key-value pairs of session variables and their associated values. This data is stored in a Python dictionary variable called **session**. Every session object has at least two keys:

  * A username (as a String)
  * A Session ID (as an Integer)
      
If my username is hzontine and my Session ID is 4, then my code would look like:

{%highlight python%}
user_name = 'hzontine'
s_id = 4
session['username'] = user_name
session['id'] = s_id
{%endhighlight%}
