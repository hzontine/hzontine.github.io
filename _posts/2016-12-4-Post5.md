# What is a Session?
  
  A session is the interval time starting when a client logs into a server and ending when he/she logs out. Session data is stored in a temporary directory and must remain on the server until the client leaves. Sessions are essential if you wish to keep a user logged in to the site, to personalize the layout of the site for users who are logged in, or track users who visit the site.
 
  A session with each client is assigned a Session ID. The data is stored on top of cookies and the server cryptographically signs them. In order to do this encryption, your Flask application must defined a SECRET_KEY.
  
  
  app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'

  
  

Session object is also a dictionary object containing key-value pairs of session variables and associated values.


 
 The data in a session is stored in a Python dictionary called session. To modify it, you need to create a new key and store some value in session.

session['username'] = username
session['id'] = id
