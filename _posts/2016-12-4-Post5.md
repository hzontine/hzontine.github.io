A session is the interval time starting when a client logs into a server and ending when he/she logs out. Session data is stored in a temporary directory and must remain on the server until the client leaves. Sessions are essential if you wish to keep a user logged in to the site, to personalize the layout of the site for users who are logged in, or track users who visit the site.
 
A session with each client is assigned a Session ID. The data is stored on top of cookies and the server cryptographically signs them. In order to do this, your Flask application must defined a SECRET_KEY.

{%highlight python%}
  
  from flask import Flask, session
  app = Flask(__name__)
  app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret!'
  app.debug = True

{%endhighlight%}

A session object is a dictionary object composing key-value pairs of session variables and their associated values. This data is store in a Python dictionary variable called **session**. 
  * Default Keys for every session object:
    * A user's username (as a string)
    * Session ID (as an Integer)
      
{%highlight python%}

  session['username'] = username
  session['id'] = id
